                <h3 class="mt-3"><b>The Psalms</b></h3><br> Book of the Old Testament composed of sacred songs, or of sacred poems meant to be sung. In the Hebrew Bible, Psalms begins the third and last section of the biblical canon, known as the Writings (Hebrew Ketuvim).

                <p>In the original Hebrew text the book as a whole was not named, although the titles of many individual psalms contained the word mizmor, meaning a poem sung to the accompaniment of a stringed instrument. The Greek translation of this term, psalmos, is the basis for the collective title Psalmoi found in most manuscripts, from which the English name Psalms is derived. A variant translation found in a 5th-century manuscript of the Septuagint is Psaltērion, whence the English name Psalter, which is often used as an alternative name for the Book of Psalms or for a separate collection of psalms intended for liturgical use. Rabbinic literature uses the title Tehillim (“Songs of Praise”), a curious hybrid of a feminine noun and a masculine plural ending.

                <p>In its present form, the book of Psalms consists of 150 poems divided into five books (1–41, 42–72, 73–89, 90–106, 107–150), the first four of which are marked off by concluding doxologies. Psalm 150 serves as a doxology for the entire collection. This specific numbering follows the Hebrew Bible; slight variations, such as conjoined or subdivided psalms, occur in other versions. The fivefold division is perhaps meant to be an imitation of the Pentateuch (the first five books of the Old Testament), suggesting that the book reached its present form through liturgical use.

                <p>The psalms also had a profound effect on the development of Christian worship. Saint Luke believed the psalms to be a source of guidance. Obeying Saint Paul’s call to “sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,” the early Church chanted or sang psalms as part of the liturgy. After the Reformation, psalms were set to traditional melodies for congregational singing.</p>
