												<h2>Customer Obsession</h2>
												<p>
													Leaders start with the
													customer and work backwards.
													They work vigorously to earn
													and keep customer trust.
													Although leaders pay
													attention to competitors,
													they obsess over customers.
												</p>
												<h2>Ownership</h2>
												<p>
													Leaders are owners. They
													think long term and don’t
													sacrifice long-term value
													for short-term results. They
													act on behalf of the entire
													company, beyond just their
													own team. They never say
													“that’s not my job.”
												</p>
												<h2>Invent and Simplify</h2>
												<p>
													Leaders expect and require
													innovation and invention
													from their teams and always
													find ways to simplify. They
													are externally aware, look
													for new ideas from
													everywhere, and are not
													limited by “not invented
													here.” As we do new things,
													we accept that we may be
													misunderstood for long
													periods of time.

										<h2>Are Right, A Lot</h2>
										<p>
											Leaders are right a lot. They have
											strong judgment and good instincts.
											They seek diverse perspectives and
											work to disconfirm their beliefs.
										</p>
										<h2>Learn and Be Curious</h2>
										<p>
											Leaders are never done learning and
											always seek to improve themselves.
											They are curious about new
											possibilities and act to explore
											them.
										</p>
										<h2>Hire and Develop the Best</h2>
										<p>
											Leaders raise the performance bar
											with every hire and promotion. They
											recognize exceptional talent, and
											willingly move them throughout the
											organization. Leaders develop
											leaders and take seriously their
											role in coaching others. We work on
											behalf of our people to invent
											mechanisms for development like
											Career Choice.
										</p>
										<h2>Insist on the Highest Standards</h2>
										<p>
											Leaders have relentlessly high
											standards—many people may think
											these standards are unreasonably
											high. Leaders are continually
											raising the bar and drive their
											teams to deliver high-quality
											products, services, and processes.
											Leaders ensure that defects do not
											get sent down the line and that
											problems are fixed so they stay
											fixed.
										</p>
									</div>
									<div id="section3">
										<br />
										<hr />
										<br />
										<h2>Think Big</h2>
										<p>
											Thinking small is a self-fulfilling
											prophecy. Leaders create and
											communicate a bold direction that
											inspires results. They think
											differently and look around corners
											for ways to serve customers.
										</p>
										<h2>Bias for Action</h2>
										<p>
											Speed matters in business. Many
											decisions and actions are reversible
											and do not need extensive study. We
											value calculated risk taking.
										</p>
										<h2>Frugality</h2>
										<p>
											Accomplish more with less.
											Constraints breed resourcefulness,
											self-sufficiency and invention.
											There are no extra points for
											growing headcount, budget size, or
											fixed expense.
										</p>
										<h2>Earn Trust</h2>
										<p>
											Leaders listen attentively, speak
											candidly, and treat others
											respectfully. They are vocally
											self-critical, even when doing so is
											awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do
											not believe their or their team’s
											body odor smells of perfume. They
											benchmark themselves and their teams
											against the best.
										</p>
										<h2>Dive Deep</h2>
										<p>
											Leaders operate at all levels, stay
											connected to the details, audit
											frequently, and are skeptical when
											metrics and anecdote differ. No task
											is beneath them.
										</p>
									</div>
									<div id="section4">
										<br />
										<hr />
										<br />
										<h2>
											Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
										</h2>
										<p>
											Leaders are obligated to
											respectfully challenge decisions
											when they disagree, even when doing
											so is uncomfortable or exhausting.
											Leaders have conviction and are
											tenacious. They do not compromise
											for the sake of social cohesion.
											Once a decision is determined, they
											commit wholly.
										</p>
										<h2>Deliver Results</h2>
										<p>
											Leaders focus on the key inputs for
											their business and deliver them with
											the right quality and in a timely
											fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise
											to the occasion and never settle.
										</p>
										<h2>
											Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer
										</h2>
										<p>
											Leaders work every day to create a
											safer, more productive, higher
											performing, more diverse, and more
											just work environment. They lead
											with empathy, have fun at work, and
											make it easy for others to have fun.
											Leaders ask themselves: Are my
											fellow employees growing? Are they
											empowered? Are they ready for what’s
											next? Leaders have a vision for and
											commitment to their employees’
											personal success, whether that be at
											Amazon or elsewhere.

										<h2>
											Success and Scale Bring Broad
											Responsibility
										</h2>
										<p>
											We started in a garage, but we’re
											not there anymore. We are big, we
											impact the community, and we are far
											from perfect. We must be humble and
											thoughtful about even the secondary
											effects of our actions. Our local
											communities, environment, and future
											generations need us to be better
											every day. We must begin each day
											with a determination to make better,
											do better, and be better for our
											customers, our employees, our
											partners, and the world at large.
											And we must end every day knowing we
											can do even more tomorrow. Leaders
											create more than they consume and
											always
