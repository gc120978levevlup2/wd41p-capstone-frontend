												<b>Return Policy</b>

										</h2>
										<p>
											Our policy lasts 30 days. If 30 days
											have gone by since your purchase,
											unfortunately we can’t offer you a
											refund or exchange.
										</p>
										<p>
											To be eligible for a return, your
											item must be unused and in the same
											condition that you received it. It
											must also be in the original
											packaging.
										</p>
										<p>
											For information about products that
											can't be returned, see Items that
											Can't be Returned.
										</p>
										<p>
											To determine if a product sold by{" "}
											<b> 3CCCi </b> has a longer return
											timeline, locate the product type
											below.
										</p>
										<p>
											If the product type isn't listed or
											doesn't state another returns time
											frame, our standard 30-day return
											policy applies.
										</p>
										<p>
											While most sellers offer a returns
											policy equivalent to <b> 3CCCi </b>{" "}
											s, some seller returns policies may
											vary.
										</p>
										<p>
											If the seller's listing is eligible
											for <b> 3CCCi </b> Prime, it will be
											subject to the same return policies
											as items fulfilled by <b> 3CCCi </b>
											com that are outlined on this page.
										</p>

										<p>
											Once your return is received and
											inspected, we will send you an email
											to notify you that we have received
											your returned item. We will also
											notify you of the approval or
											rejection of your refund.
										</p>
										<p>
											When you return an item, your refund
											amount and refund method may vary.
											Check the payment method refunded
											and the status of your refund in
											Your Orders.
										</p>
										<p>
											When returning an item, you have the
											option to choose your preferred
											refund method in the Online Returns
											Center. After the carrier receives
											your item, it can take up to two
											weeks for us to receive and process
											your return.
										</p>
										<p>
											Certain items can take up to 30
											days. We typically process returns
											within 3-5 business days after the
											carrier delivers the item to our
											Returns Center. When we complete
											processing your return, we issue a
											refund to the selected payment
											method. Learn how to Track Your
											Return.
										</p>
										<p>
											If you want to use your refund
											without waiting for us to process
											your return, you can select the
											Instant Refund option, if available.
											Instant refunds are either refunded
											to your credit card or issued as an{" "}
											<b> 3CCCi </b>.com Gift Card
											balance. You'll still need to return
											your items within 30 days.

											The type of refund or credit a gift
											recipient receives depends on how
											the giver purchased the gift and how
											the recipient returns the gift. For
											more information, go to Return a
											Gift. <b> 3CCCi </b> may determine
											that a gift recipient is eligible
											for a refund without requiring a
											return. If a gift return is eligible
											for a refund without returning the
											item, the gift recipient receives a
											notification in the Returns Center
											or via Customer Service. For more
											information, go to Conditions of
											Use.
										</p>
										<p>
											If you are approved, then your
											refund will be processed, and a

											to your credit card or original
											method of payment, within a certain
											amount of days.
